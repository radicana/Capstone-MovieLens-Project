# Capstone-MovieLens-Project
In this project, we will be creating a movie recommendation system using the 10M version of the MovieLens dataset (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/). You can find the entire latest MovieLens dataset here(https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/).  

It consists of 3 documents:  
system recomendation.Rmd  
system recomendation.pdf  
movie recomendation.R   

In order to predict the rating for movie i by the user u, we consider the movie and user effect. We use regularization to achieve a better result.
